# Other Integrations

In addition to Jira, ReleaseOwl supports key integrations to streamline DevOps workflows:

* **DocuSign Integration**: ReleaseOwl integrates with DocuSign to automate approval processes during deployment. Teams can configure approval gates that require digital signatures, ensuring compliance and audit-readiness before promoting changes to higher environments.
* **ReleaseOwl Callout Framework**: The Callout Framework allows custom integrations with third-party systems using secure REST-based callbacks. This enables advanced use cases such as triggering external validations, notifying business stakeholders, or interacting with internal tools before or after specific pipeline stages.
