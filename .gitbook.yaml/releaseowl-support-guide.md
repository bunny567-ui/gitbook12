  * **Agent workload**
  * **Expertise**
  * **Shift availability**

#### **Initial Response & Acknowledgment**

* Agents can **acknowledge** tickets within the following response time:

| **Priority** | **L1 Response** | **L2 Response** | **L3 Response** |

| **High**     | 1 hour          | 1 hour          | 1 hour          |

| **Low**      | 4 hours         | 4 hours         | 4 hours         |

#### **Investigation & Resolution**

* The support agent gathers necessary details and attempts to **replicate the issue**.
* If the resolution is straightforward, the agent provides a **step-by-step guide**.
* If further investigation is needed:
  * The ticket is **escalated** to the technical team.
  * The **customer is notified** about the escalation status.

#### **Customer Communication**

* The agent provides **timely updates** based on ticket priority.
* If a **workaround** is available, it is shared until a **permanent fix** is implemented.
* All communications are **logged in ZOHO Desk** for reference.

#### **Ticket Closure**

* A ticket is marked as **Closed** once the customer confirms the issue is resolved.
* The support team sends a reminder email to check whether the issue is resolved. If there is no response, the ticket will be considered resolved and closed. If the issue persists, the customer can reopen the ticket.
