# SAP API

SAP APIs enable seamless integration between SAP and external systems using OData, SOAP, and RFC/BAPI calls. ReleaseOwl supports SAP API deployments by managing transport requests across SAP landscapes (Dev → QA → Prod). Users can configure API endpoints, set up authentication (Basic, OAuth, SAML), and securely store credentials within ReleaseOwl.
