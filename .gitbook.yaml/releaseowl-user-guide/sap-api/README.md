# SAP API

ReleaseOwl integrates seamlessly with **SAP API Management** to automate the deployment and promotion of API-related artifacts across different environments. This ensures consistent and reliable delivery of API services in a DevOps-enabled SAP landscape.

Key artifacts supported include:

* **API Proxies**: These act as secure interfaces to backend SAP or non-SAP systems. ReleaseOwl enables automated deployment and version-controlled promotion of these proxies, ensuring controlled exposure of APIs to external or internal consumers.
* **Key Value Maps (KVMs)**: These are used to store environment-specific configurations like backend URLs, tokens, or other dynamic values. ReleaseOwl automates the creation and update of KVMs, allowing smooth configuration management during deployments.
