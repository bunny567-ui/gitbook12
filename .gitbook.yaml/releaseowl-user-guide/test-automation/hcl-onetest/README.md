**HCL OneTest UI Integration with ReleaseOwl**

HCL OneTest UI is a functional testing tool which can be integrated with ReleaseOwl to perform functional testing and Web UI testing.

Functional Testing - You can generate functional testing scripts by recording against the application under test. It uses object-oriented recording technology. You can insert or edit verification points in the functional testing scripts without opening the test application.

Web UI Testing - You can quickly create and run functional tests for the web applications. It gives you a recording and natural language scripting environment to test browser applications that use HTML5 and JQuery. You can test on Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari browsers
