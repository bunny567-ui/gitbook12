# SAP On-Premise

SAP On-Premise systems are traditional SAP ECC & S/4 HANA landscapes hosted within an organization’s own data center. ReleaseOwl natively supports SAP On-Premise by providing an end-to-end DevOps platform that automates transport management, streamlines change delivery, and accelerates release cycles across ABAP systems.
