# Working with Release Pipelines

When working with **Release Pipelines**, the deployment lifecycle is streamlined using a combination of **automation**, **approvals**, and **task orchestration**. The pipeline is composed of multiple **task types**, each designed to handle a specific stage of the deployment process. These tasks ensure a controlled, repeatable, and auditable workflow from build to production.
