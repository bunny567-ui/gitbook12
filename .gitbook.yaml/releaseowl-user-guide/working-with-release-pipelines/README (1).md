# Working with Release Pipelines

ReleaseOwl Pipelines provide a unified and automated framework to manage the complete release lifecycle for SAP applications across On-Premise and BTP landscapes. Each pipeline is built using a sequence of tasks—such as build, deploy, validate, approve, and promote—ensuring that every change moves through a structured, consistent, and compliant process.

&#x20;

Releaseowl orchestrates these tasks across multiple stages (Dev, QA, Prod), enabling teams to enforce governance, reduce manual effort, and eliminate deployment risks. With real-time visibility, audit trails, and automated handoffs, ReleaseOwl Pipelines deliver a fully managed CI/CD experience tailored for SAP environments, accelerating delivery while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.
