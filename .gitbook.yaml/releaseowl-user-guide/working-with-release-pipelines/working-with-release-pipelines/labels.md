# Labels

Labels are like tags for your ‘**Build Pipelines**’. When a client has a substantial number of build pipelines, sorting through them can become difficult. Labels can help categorize your pipelines into smaller groups that can be viewed in the drop down on the top right corner of the build pipeline page.

To add a pipeline to a label, you can type a label name while creating the pipeline. While typing, auto completion will kick in and show the list of possible existing labels, either you can select one from the list or provide a new label. When a build pipeline/ release pipeline is saved, if the label is new, it will create a new entry to Labels list. Or you could edit a pipeline after it has been created and add a label in the available dialogue box.\

The same process can be conducted through the ‘**Release Pipelines**’ tab as well.
