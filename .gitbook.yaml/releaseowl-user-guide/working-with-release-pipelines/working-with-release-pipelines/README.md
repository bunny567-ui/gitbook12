# Working with Release Pipelines

When working with **Release Pipelines**, the deployment lifecycle is streamlined through automation and approvals. The process typically involves the following key components:

**1. Approval Process**

* A controlled workflow where **approvals are required** at specific stages before proceeding with transport imports or deployments.
* Ensures that only validated and authorized changes are promoted across environments.

**2. Automated Transport Import and Promotion**

* Release Pipelines handle **automated import of transports** into target systems.
* Includes **transport promotion**, ensuring consistent and traceable movement of changes across landscapes (e.g., Dev → QA → Prod).

**3. Automated MTAR Deployments**

* Supports the **automated deployment of MTAR files** (Multi-Target Application Archives) to SAP BTP environments.
* Reduces manual effort and eliminates deployment errors through automation.

**4. Automated CPI Deployments**

* Enables **automated deployment of CPI (Cloud Platform Integration) artifacts** to both **design time** and **runtime** environments.
* Ensures smooth and efficient delivery of integration content.

**5. Types of Tasks**

* Release Pipelines consist of various **task types** to support the deployment process.
