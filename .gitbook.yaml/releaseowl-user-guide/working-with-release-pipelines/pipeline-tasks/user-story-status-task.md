| **User Story Status**   | <p>Select appropriate status to which the current status of the user story has to be changed once the deployment to specific environment is done.<br><br>The available status options are:<br><br><strong>To Do</strong> – The user story status can be reset to - To Do once the deployment is done in any specific environment. For e.g., the same user story can be deployed to multiple environments one after the other and in each stage the status has to be reset to - To Do as the process has to be repeated.<br><br><strong>In Progress</strong> – The user story status can be set to In Progress when the implementation of user story is still work in progress or done in a phased manner .<br><br><strong>Ready for QA</strong> – The user story status can be set to Ready for QA once the deployment is done in QA and is available for testing.<br><br><strong>Done</strong> - The user story status can be set to done once working with the user story is complete after deploying the changes to the specific environment.</p> |

| **Continue on Failure** | Enable this option if you want the pipeline to proceed with the subsequent tasks even if one task fails. This is useful when multiple tasks are configured in a stage and a failure in one task should not block the execution of the remaining tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
