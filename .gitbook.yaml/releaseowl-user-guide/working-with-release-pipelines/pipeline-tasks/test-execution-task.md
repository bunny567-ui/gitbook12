# Test Execution Task

A **Test Execution Task** in ReleaseOwl is a pipeline task used to automatically run test cases after a deployment. It allows integration with external testing tools (such as **HCL OneTest UI** or **Tosca**) so that functional, regression, or web tests can be executed in the target environment.\
