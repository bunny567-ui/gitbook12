# Release Transport Task

### Release Transport Task&#x20;

The **Release Transport Task** is responsible for automating the **manual transport release** process that typically occurs before deployment. Instead of manually releasing transports in the **Transport Management System (TMS)**, this task ensures that transports are released within the pipeline itself before they are imported into the target system.
