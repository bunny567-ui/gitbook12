# Administration

The **Administration** section enables administrators to manage and configure secure connections between ReleaseOwl and SAP Analytics Cloud.\
This setup involves two key administrative configurations:

1. **Credential Registration** – To securely connect ReleaseOwl with SAC using OAuth credentials.
2. **Environment Registration** – To register specific SAC environments (e.g., Development, QA, Production) within ReleaseOwl.
