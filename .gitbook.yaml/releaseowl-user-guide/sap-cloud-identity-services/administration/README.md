# Administration

The **Administration** section covers the foundational setup required to enable secure communication between SAP Cloud Identity Services, SAP BTP, and ReleaseOwl. This includes managing authentication details and preparing environments to use these credentials during deployments.\
It is divided into two key parts:

#### **1. Credential Management**

This subsection explains how to register and manage credentials required for connecting ReleaseOwl with SAP Cloud Identity Services. By storing these credentials securely in the Credential Manager, ReleaseOwl can authenticate with your identity tenant during various deployment and integration operations.

#### **2. Environment Registration**

This subsection focuses on associating the registered credentials with specific ReleaseOwl environments. Environment Registration ensures that the correct identity configuration is applied during deployment pipelines, validations, and authentication workflows.
