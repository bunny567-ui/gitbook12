# Administration

In ReleaseOwl, the SAP BTP Administration section is responsible for configuring secure access and connectivity to BTP services. Administrators manage the core setup required for ReleaseOwl to interact with SAP Cloud Integration and other BTP components. This includes:

* **Credential Management:** Registering and securely storing Basic or OAuth credentials to authenticate ReleaseOwl with SAP BTP services.
* **Cloud Environment Setup:** Registering BTP environments by providing tenant URLs, environment types (Dev, QA, Prod), and mapping the correct credentials.

These administrative configurations ensure that ReleaseOwl can securely connect, deploy, and manage artifacts across SAP BTP landscapes.
