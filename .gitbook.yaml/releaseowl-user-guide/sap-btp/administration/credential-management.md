7. **For Authentication Type OAuth2** â€“ Instead of password, authorization tokens are issued to verify an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth 2 provides better security than basic authentication as the initial requests for credentials are made under the SSL protocol and its access object is a transitory token.
