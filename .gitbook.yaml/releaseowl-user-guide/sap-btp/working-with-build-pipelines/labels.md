# Labels

Labels are like tags for your ‘**Build Pipelines**’. When a client has a substantial number of build pipelines, sorting through them can become difficult. Labels can help categorize your pipelines into smaller groups that can be viewed in the drop down on the top right corner of the build pipeline page.<br>

* To add a label to a pipeline, you can type the label name while creating the pipeline. As you type, autocomplete will suggest a list of existing labels.&#x20;
* You can either select one from the list or enter a new label. When the build or release pipeline is saved, if the label is new, it will be added to the Labels list automatically.&#x20;
* Alternatively, you can also edit the pipeline after it has been created and add a label using the available dialog box.
