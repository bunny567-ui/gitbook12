# Transport of Copies

## **Import via TOC**

Once a transport is released, no further changes can be made to it. If a fix is required, a new transport must be created. However, a more efficient alternative is **Transport of Copies (TOC)**.

Instead of releasing the transport, you can create copies of the changes and move them to a target system for testing. Any required fixes can be added as tasks to the same transport. After successful testing, the transport can be released. This approach reduces the number of transports needed for a specific feature or user story.

#### Steps to Import via TOC:

1\. Go to the required transport and click **Actions**.

2\. Choose **Import via TOC.**

3\. Select a target system id from the drop down and click **Import.**

5. The newly created TOC request can now be used for further processing.
