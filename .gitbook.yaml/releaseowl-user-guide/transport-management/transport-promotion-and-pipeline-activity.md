# Transport Promotion and Pipeline Activity

### Transport Promotion

In **ReleaseOwl**, _transport promotion_ refers to the controlled and automated movement of **Transport Requests (TRs)** across various stages of the **release pipeline**, typically from **DEV → QA → PROD**.

#### **Steps to Promote a Transport**

1. Click on the **action button (⋯)** of the transport ID.
2. Select the **Promote** option.
3. Where your transport requested promoted to the next environment (DEV, QA OR PROD).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**  Before a transport can be promoted, it **must be assigned to a User Story**.

* The **User Story** must be linked to a **Release Pipeline**.
* If not properly assigned, you will receive a warning indicating the missing association, and the promotion will not proceed.
{% endhint %}
