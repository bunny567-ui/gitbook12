# Transport Validation and Analysis Reports

### **Validate**

Validating a transport ensures that the changes comply with enterprise standards, acting as an early warning system for developers.

### **How to Validate a Transport**

1. In the **Transport Management** screen, select a transport.
2. Click **Validate** under **Actions** to trigger the validation process.

| **Release Status check**                       | Checks whether the given transport is released or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Downgrade Protection check**                 | Identifies other transport requests with identical objects which have been released in the last 90 days, but have not yet been imported to the target system.                                                                                                     |
| **Cross Reference Check (Dependencies)**       | For all objects in the selected transport request, the referenced objects are identified by a where-used- analysis. If the referenced objects are not included in the transport requests, you compare their versions between the source and target system.        |
| **Cross Release Check (package level checks)** | If the current system and the target system are on different support package levels, this check identifies critical objects in the selected transport request, which belong to inconsistent software components and should not be imported into the target system |
| **Critical Object Check**                      | It will check if the objects in this transport are a part of the critical object list. If it is, then a warning pops up.                                                                                                                                          |

### Test Execution Report

The **Test Execution Report** provides insights into the number of tests executed, including:

* Count of **successful** and **failed** tests.
* Test name, object type, and URI.
* Status (**pass** or **fail**) along with relevant messages for debugging or analysis.

This report helps identify issues early and ensures code quality before deployment.

### Code Coverage

The **Code Coverage Report** summarizes overall code coverage, including:

* **Branch Coverage**
* **Procedure Coverage**
* **Statement Coverage**

It also provides details such as **Type, Object Name, Branch Coverage, Procedure Coverage, and Statement Coverage** for specific objects. This report helps assess test effectiveness and highlights areas for improvement to enhance software quality and reliability.

### **ATC Report**&#x20;

The **ATC Report** offers a detailed analysis of **static code checks**, ensuring that ABAP programs comply with:

* **Coding standards**
* **Security guidelines**
* **Performance best practices**

Findings are categorized as **errors, warnings, and informational messages**, helping developers address potential issues effectively.
