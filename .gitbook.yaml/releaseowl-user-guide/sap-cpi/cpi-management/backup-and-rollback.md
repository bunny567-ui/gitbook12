# Backup & Rollback

The Enable Rollback option is one among the various Deployment Actions that can be performed at the time of deployment. Enable Rollback option will create a backup of the existing deployment version so that whenever any deployment fails or if there is any problem with the deployment, you can rollback the changes.

Rollback is available for CPI artifacts that are deployed to design time in addition to those published to run time. While creating a release pipeline, you must enable the option to rollback as a prerequisite. Click rollback in the deployment screen to rollback while running release pipelines. All the details pertaining to the deployment of the artifact is specified in the deployment task.

The following screen is displayed on adding a deployment task. Select the checkbox â€“ Enable Rollback and Save the changes.\
