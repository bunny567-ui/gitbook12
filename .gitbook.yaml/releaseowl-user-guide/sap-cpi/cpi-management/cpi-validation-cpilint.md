# CPI Validation - CPILint

CPILint is used to validate the IFlows. CPILint is a command line tool using which you can define a ruleset which contains things like naming schemes, use of different mapping types or scripting technologies. Once executed, CPILint reports if an IFlow is compliant to the pre-defined ruleset. This tool helps to keep up the quality of your IFlows.
