# Sprints

**Project Integration with External Systems**

Any project created in **ReleaseOwl** can be associated with an external system such as **JIRA**.

Once integrated, you can:

* Sync **Sprints**, **User Stories**, and **Backlogs** from the external system into ReleaseOwl.
* Create **Sprints**, **User Stories**, and **Backlogs** directly within **ReleaseOwl**, independent of any external system.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The changes made in the external system get synced to ReleaseOwl, but the changes made in ReleaseOwl do not sync back to the external system.
{% endhint %}

### **Syncing Sprints**

2. Once the sync is completed, the sprints created in the external system will appear in the ReleaseOwl app.
