**Note:**

1. If the **project** that you are working with is **associated** with any **external system** like **JIRA**, and if it has any **backlogs**, the backlog items appear in the **Backlog** screen upon syncâ€™ing the **user stories** in the User Stories screen.
2. Always remember to sync the **Sprints** first and then the **User Stories** followed by **Backlog**.

Click **Sync User Stories** option from the User **Stories** screen under **Change Management** section. The user stories from the external system gets **synced** to the **User Stories** screen.\

Click OK. The user stories created in the external system gets **synced** to **ReleaseOwl** and appear in the **User Stories** screen.\

Navigate to the **Backlog** screen. The synced user stories which do **not** belong to any **sprint** appear in the **Backlog** screen upon **syncing** the user stories.\

**Note:** Once the user stories of the external system are moved to any sprint, they disappear in the Backlog screen upon syncing the user stories in ReleaseOwl.

We can **create user stories** in the **backlog** by clicking **Create New User Story**.

Please refer to **Create User Stories** section for further information on how to create user stories in ReleaseOwl.
