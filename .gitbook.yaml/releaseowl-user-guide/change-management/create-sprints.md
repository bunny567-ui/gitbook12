# Create Sprints

Any project created in ReleaseOwl can be associated with an external system like JIRA.

Once a project in ReleaseOwl is integrated with that in an external system, then you can sync the sprints, user stories and backlogs.

You can also create sprints, user stories and backlogs in ReleaseOwl.

The changes done in external system gets synced to ReleaseOwl but not vice-versa.

**Sprints**

You can find Sprints under Change Management section as shown below:\
