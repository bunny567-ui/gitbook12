# Create Sprints

Any project created in ReleaseOwl can be associated with an external system like JIRA.

* Once a project in ReleaseOwl is integrated with an external system, you can sync the **Sprints**, **User Stories**, and **Backlogs**.
* You can also create **Sprints**, **User Stories**, and **Backlogs** directly in ReleaseOwl.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The changes made in the external system get synced to ReleaseOwl, but the changes made in ReleaseOwl do not sync back to the external system.
{% endhint %}

#### **Sprints**

You can find **Sprints** under the **Change Management** section as shown below:

| **Edit**            | The Sprint Details can be edited such as Sprint Name, Start Date and End Date. This feature can be used only for the sprints created in ReleaseOwl and not the ones that are synced from the external system.        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start Sprint**    | This option is for starting a sprint. This feature is for the sprints that are not yet started and can be used only for the sprints created in ReleaseOwl and not the ones that are synced from the external system. |
| **Complete Sprint** | The option is for completing a sprint that is active. This feature can be used only for the sprints created in ReleaseOwl and not ones that are synced from the external system.                                     |
| **User Stories**    | On clicking this option, the user is taken to the User Stories pertaining to the corresponding sprint where we can sync the user stories from the external system or create new user stories.                        |
