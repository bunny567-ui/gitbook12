**Note:**&#x20;

* If the project that you are working with is associated with any external system like JIRA, and if it has any backlogs, the backlog items appear in the **Backlog** screen upon syncing the user stories in the **User Stories** screen.
* Always remember to:
  1. Sync the **Sprints** first.
  2. Sync the **User Stories**, followed by the **Backlog**.
